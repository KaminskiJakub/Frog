# Frog
Practice of Git and GitHub.

Instructions for the exercise:

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D. Count minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function :
class Solution {
public int solution (int X, int Y, int D) }
that, given three integers X,Y,D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal or greater than Y.

For example, given:
X=10, Y=85, D=30.

The function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follow: after the first jump, at position 10+30=40, after second jump at position 10+30+30=70, after the third jump, at position 10+30+30+30=100.
